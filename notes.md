# Notes

## object syntax

### dot notation
object.property

### bracket notation
object["property"]

## JSON
Linting is a way of using a software to check for syntax errors.
jsonlint.com is where you can go to check your source code.
This is also called the object literal notation.

## Control flow

### Tip
You should never use ==, always use ===.
One is loose equality, the other is strict equality.
### Functions
There are two ways to do this.

#### First way
    var myFunc = function(param1, param2, ..., etc) {
      // code goes there
    }

#### Second way
  function myFunc(param1, param2, ..., etc) {
    // code goes here
  }
