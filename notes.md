# JavaScript Basic Notes

## Object Syntax

__Dot Notation__

    object.property

__Bracket Notation__

    object["property"]

## JSON

Linting is a way of using a software to check for syntax errors.
www.jsonlint.com is where you can go to check your source code.
This is also called the object literal notation.

## Control flow

### Tip
You should never use ==, always use ===.
One is loose equality, the other is strict equality.

### Functions
There are two ways to do this.

__First way__

    var myFunc = function(param1, param2, ..., etc) {
      // code goes there
    }

__Second way__

    function myFunc(param1, param2, ..., etc) {
      // code goes here
    }
